# Direct Mail

The »Direct Mail« extension implements an advanced newsletter mailer system for the [TYPO3 CMS](https://typo3.org). This extension provides not only a system for sending a newsletter from TYPO3 CMS, but also personalizing it and collect some statistics.

The extension builds a newsletter based on a TYPO3 page, so that you can create newsletter layout the same way you create a website layout. It also lets editors select between different recipient groups for each newsletter.

The extension provides several scheduler tasks to let integrators control when and how much newsletters are send, and to analyze bounce mails.
